## Introduction

In this project, I implemented a variation of a recursive descent parser, a technique that uses recursive procedures to process input and construct a parse tree. This code was developed as a conceptual exercise for a larger project, and serves as a study case for understanding the functionality of trees and then apply the same code in Rust.

I also used tools such as Poetry, Pyenv, Unittest, and Pdb during development to learn more about them. Overall, this project was a great source of knowledge for me.


## Explanation

The recursive descent parser works by breaking down the input into smaller and smaller "tokens" until it reaches the atomic elements of the language. It then combines the tokens in a specific order to construct the parse tree. Maybe I'll expand this topic in the future.

In writing this code, I aimed to make it as concise as possible while also ensuring it would be easily reproducible in the future. Despite the complexity of recursion and my own lack of knowledge, I believe I have achieved this to the best of my ability.


## Conclusion

As I reflect on this project, there are a few things I would like to note about the tools I used:

-   Poetry: While it serves a similar purpose to venv, I found it difficult to install alongside pywev on Windows.
-   Pyenv: Make sure to delete any existing versions of Python before installing Pyenv. I learned this lesson too late.
-   Unittest: While somewhat unusual to use, I found it to be competent and easy to use. I will continue to use it in the future.
-   Pdb: I can't believe it took me so long to start using a proper debugging tool.
-   ChatGPT: Without this tool, I wouldn't have made much progress on this project.

Overall, this was a valuable learning experience and I hope to remember what I have learned when I return to this code in the future.
